# MCNet
This code is the implementation of our paper MCNet [2], using the matlab interface of Caffe [1]. We suggest you using caffe-happynear (https://github.com/happynear/caffe-windows), which is a popular compiled windows version of Caffe.

We give examples (mcnet_29.m, mcnet_68.m) for obtaining the face alignment results on COFW [3] and IBUG [4].

If you find our code useful in your research work, please cite [2].

Should you have any questions, then just contact with us through email, shaozhiwen@sjtu.edu.cn.
